#eVHDL
This application defines a new VHDL syntaxis, to be used in Python.

It has however quite a few bugs and downsides, as meaningful as for a rewrite to be needed. Version 2 will be using trees for operation (AND, OR...) concatenation, along with general improvements in tracing back and graphics.
ETA unknown.
